    <h5>My name is Anastasia Sergeeva, I’m a third year student of Information Design course in St. Petersburg Polytechnic University. I would like to take part in an exchange program between our Universities for autumn semester 2018-2019. 
        I had an experience in studying abroad since childhood. The first course I had taken was Summer Art Explores at age of 9 years in the USA. Last year I took part in a month exchange program with Hong Kong Polytechnic University and it was very useful for me in understanding different views in design, in cooperating with other people and improving language skills. Participating in exchange programs gives opportunity to investigate a new culture, connect with different people from other countries, being involved in studying process that could differ from familiar one. It is very excited to have experience in work with international team as well as to get more information and learn different principles of design. It will allow me to expand my knowledge and define my opportunities as a specialist for future. 
        I graduated from the art school where I used to learn since I was 5 years old. So art is a part of my life and I want to continue moving in this way. Now I have a lot of interests such as: contemporary art, 3D design, game development, animation and illustration. I really want to try my best in different spheres and I'm open for new knowledge and achievements.
        I motivated to study in а L’École de design Nantes Atlantique because I heard positive feedbacks about it from my friends. I’m very interested in subjects that are offered for exchange students: digital media, visual programming, 3D-modeling. They definitely can improve my skills and give a lot of benefits for future profession. So my studying goal in L’École de design is to get a strong practical and theoretical experience and also in future I hope that this semester will help me to enter the Master’s program in EU. Also I have never been long in France and it will be a great chance to know more about French culture and people. </h5>
